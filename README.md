# LGSM - Web Interface
Web Interface for LSGM
This version has been written with PHP 7 in mind but should still work with PHP 5.5x
This software needs configuing before it will work - currently there is no utility to do this, if you wish to try it contact the author

For this Software to work at it's best, it can use the Webmin API so you may want to install webmin on the server you wish to host your games on.
Remember this can be a different server to where the web interface code is placed.
